New stuff:
- zsh
- Background jobs (Ctrl-Z, bg, fg, etc)
- ~10% performance improvement from correctly tracking the last JIT block
- top runs (though it's useless since CPU usage is always displayed as 0%)

UI stuff:
- Option in settings to change launch command (also general settings reorganization)

Bug fixes:
- Rounding error when adding 18446744073709551616 and 1.5
- Crash when trying to run top
- Selection being immediately copied to the clipboard if Speak Selection is enabled in iOS settings
- Make a test network connection on startup, to hopefully fix network permission popup not appearing on devices sold in China
- Crash when running a script with a #! line pointing to a nonexistent file
- ^C not appearing when you press Ctrl-C and it kills the program
- Ctrl-C not flushing the input buffer
- Arrow keys not working in some programs
- Emacs and Ruby summoning nasal demons after receiving a signal
