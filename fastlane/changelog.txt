Bug fixes and stability improvements!
- Recovery mode now allows you to make the app open straight into settings, so you can still change settings if the app crashes on launch
- Fixed node/npm segfaulting randomly
- Fixed crash if the filesystem's root can't be opened, which would happen when importing an Ubuntu Base rootfs (now shows an error instead)
- Importing a filesystem now always creats a root inode
