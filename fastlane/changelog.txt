Fixed bugs:
- Free space reported incorrectly (now rtorrent doesn't shut down thinking it's out of disk space)
- Total memory reported incorrectly
- Incorrect 16-bit signed right shifting on arm
- Composer deleting its own output (it thought the directory was empty, it was not)

New stuff:
- VoiceOver reads terminal output, making iSH the best iOS terminal for blind people by a long shot. Seriously, why is every other terminal so broken? Blink doesn't read new output even though it uses the same terminal emulator as iSH, Shelly won't let you select anything in the terminal, Termius doesn't let you select anything at all.
