Fixed bugs:
- Option->Meta map setting having no effect. It was looking at the caps lock setting instead :facepalm:. Now you can actually type characters that require AltGr.
- Braille screen input not working
- Incorrect VoiceOver labels on some of the keyboard buttons
- Arrow keys in VoiceOver could only be swiped once in a direction
- Long press on delete key not working
- Transmission printing errors about not being able to set the receive buffer size

New stuff:
- IME support, so you can type text in Chinese or Japanese, and also use dead keys. Unfortunately the in-progress text doesn't appear on screen, but at least you can type at all.
- Long press on delete key works
- Dictation vaguely works
- /proc/mounts so you can see your list of mounts. You can even run df -h and see how much free space you have. It gives a real answer!
- Location tracking through /dev/location. Reading from this device will start tracking your location and output a line each time your location updates. It also supports background tracking, so you can get the app to run in the background with the following incantation:

cat /dev/location > /dev/null &
