This build fixes apk crashing dramatically on actual iOS devices but not in the simulator. Also, I forgot to tell you that to get Internet working, you have to configure DNS, which means creating an /etc/resolv.conf with "nameserver 8.8.8.8" or whatever DNS server you want to use. The easiest way to do that is run this command: 

echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf

At some point I'm going to make this be automatically created.

You can log in as root with no password. (Someday I'm going to get rid of that username prompt...)

As always, let me know if it crashes spectacularly. The best place to send bug reports or feedback of any kind is the GitHub issues page: https://github.com/tbodt/ish/issues
