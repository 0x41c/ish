Fixed programs:
- Emacs
- Perl
- dialog
- ping (thanks @wallisch)
- I accidentally installed shadow and coreutils and everything broke. Instead of reinstalling and losing my filesystem I fixed everything.

Not exactly a fixed program but almost as awesome:
- /dev/random and /dev/urandom (thanks @lunixbochs)

UI improvements:
- Arrow keys being invisible to VoiceOver, as well as a couple other VoiceOver tweaks
- Better hide keyboard button
- Stepper for font size selection
- Auto lock control setting

Fixed bugs:
- resolv.conf not getting truncated when overwritten
- SIGWINCH with no handler installed interrupting blocking syscalls
- GCJ crashing the app (it still fails for many other reasons, oh well)
