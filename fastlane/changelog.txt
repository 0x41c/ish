New in this build: Internet support! wget should work out of the box, and you should be able to run apk update and then install packages from the Alpine package database.

You can log in as root with no password. (Someday I'm going to get rid of that username prompt...)

As always, let me know if it crashes spectacularly. The best place to send bug reports or feedback of any kind is the GitHub issues page: https://github.com/tbodt/ish/issues
