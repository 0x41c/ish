Bug fixes with no improvements. Specifically, these are fixed:
- ssh and screen being completely broken for people who installed the app fresh instead of updating from a previous version
- Segfault when a non-main thread forks and then exits and the child exits afterwards
- Deadlock that hangs the app once in a while
