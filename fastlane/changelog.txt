Fixed bugs:
- A couple hangs and crashes revealed by running `npm` in a loop

New stuff:
- Return cache optimization by @wishstudio, makes things about 10% faster
- Replace the terminal emulator with hterm
- Fixed scrolling once and for all

You heard that right. Scrolling is working on iOS 13, you can even see the scrollbar! At least until some future iOS version breaks it. Also you can now copy stuff from the terminal without also copying large amounts of whitespace from the end of each line.
