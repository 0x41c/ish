IMPORTANT: You will need to uninstall the app before installing this build, otherwise you'll get an error on launch.

The big fix here is changing the database from GDBM to SQLite, making it like 100x more reliable. No more mysterious vanishing files! (If any of your files do mysteriously vanish, please tell me.)

A couple other fixes: pip and ffmpeg no longer segfault when expanding large allocations, and files actually show up in the Files app like they're supposed to. So you can use youtube-dl to download separate audio and video, extract them through the Files app, and have no way of merging them!
