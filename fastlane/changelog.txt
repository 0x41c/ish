HOTFIX for last build that would crash as soon as you tapped the close button on the about box. Release notes for previous build pasted below for your convenience.

Fixed bugs:
- Line drawing characters appearing as q and x
- Illegal instruction in latest gcc
- Reported "out of memory" when running composer install
- Vim looking totally screwed up in screen/tmux
- "Permission denied" when using gcc with a non-root user
- "Bad file descriptor" when using socketpair in python
- GPG crashing
- ssh-agent crashing
- Fixed clear screen shortcut

New stuff:
- Dark theme in about box if your terminal is dark
- Elixir/Erlang kinda works about 20% of the time
- Backtick->escape and option->meta mappings
- SF Symbols on iOS 13
- Hyperlinks using escape sequences
