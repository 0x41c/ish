Fixed bugs:
- Weird hangs when using zsh
- Hang on fish startup
- Might have fixed someone's crash when using imagemagick
- Bad system call from dig
- Giant memory leak where part of a mapped file would never be freed on iOS. Now you can compile large programs without an out of memory crash!
- Crash when installing things with composer

New stuff:
- /dev/clipboard exists and provides read/write access to your iOS clipboard. Thanks to @stek29 on github for making this happen.

Again, nothing new on the iOS 13 scrolling front. Someone sent a pull request that enabled xterm's builtin scrolling emulation, but it doesn't support momentum scrolling. I'm starting to think the most reasonable thing to do would be to reimplement momentum scrom first principles. That at least seems much easier than text selection.
